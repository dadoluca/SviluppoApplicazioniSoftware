# Cat & Ring
*Translated from Italian. The project was conducted in Italian.*

The project was developed following the principles of the UP (Unified Process) methodology, which includes:
- **Requirements Analysis:** Using Use Cases, System Sequence Diagrams (SSD), and contracts to identify and define the system requirements thoroughly.
- **Design:** Domain model and UML static modeling with Design Class Diagrams (DCD) and dynamic Design Sequence Diagrams. These tools allowed to define the system architecture and workflows clearly and in detail.
- **Implementation:** Simple implementation is not the project's goal

## Project Description
Cat & Ring is an application for managing a catering company, providing tools for organizing events and managing the kitchen. The application allows organizers to detail events, manage staff, and supervise ongoing activities. Chefs can create recipes, define menus for events, and manage the recipe book. Cooks prepare dishes following the chefs' instructions.

## Key Features
- **Event Organization:** Organizers can create and detail events, assign staff, and supervise activities during events.
- **Staff Management:** Organizers can enter staff availability, while chefs and cooks manage the recipe book.
- **Recurring Events:** It is possible to manage recurring events, keeping track of previous menus and associated clients.
- **Assignment of Kitchen Tasks:** Chefs assign tasks to cooks, monitoring the progress of activities.
- **Recipes and Preparations:** Users can enter recipes and preparations into the recipe book, specifying ingredients, instructions, and timings.
- **Menu Creation:** Chefs can create menus from recipes in the recipe book, managing additional information such as the presence of cooks during service and the type of dishes.

## Examples of Events
Cat & Ring handles single events, complex events in a single day, and events that span multiple days. It can also manage recurring events, with menu variations from day to day or year to year.
